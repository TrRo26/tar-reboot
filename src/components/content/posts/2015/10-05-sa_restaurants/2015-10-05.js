        // postSubTitle: "Take a break from wandering the mean streets of Sweden's capital and try one of these eight delicious eateries",

        // Of the numerous conversations I’ve spent declaring to the uninitiated, reminiscing with the like-minded and debating with the skeptics as to the wonders of Stockholm, the topic of delectable food usually takes a while to work its way into the discussion, if it does at all. However, on the rare occasion when an exchange manages to meander it’s way to the culinary end of the spectrum, I’m often surprised to hear words such as ‘bland’ and ‘boring’ so liberally peppered throughout the conversation. While perhaps not a mecca for restaurant enthusiasts, I have always been impressed with the wide variety of ethnic fare available along with the consistent quality of dishes offered throughout the Swedish capital. So, in the hopes of turning a few doubters into believers, I’ve compiled a short list of, in my humble opinion, some of the better places around the city that are well worth Scandinavia’s borderline extortionate prices.
        // *Note – I did not include any Thai restaurants on the list, as I have yet to find a bad one.

        // Tucked away on the far side of the island of Kungsholmen in the Fridhemsplan area, the unassuming entrance down a quiet side street leads to a set of stairs spiraling up to this hip and modern chophouse. Not for the squeamish, fresh cuts of meat dangle from hooks on the landing as you walk in before being offered the choice of grabbing a drink in the bustling bar area or diving right into their fantastic selection of dishes. Cuts are listed by country of origin and come with that respective nation’s flag perched on top making sampling a few different selections that much more enjoyable. This place sports a fairly comprehensive wine list as well – if you happen to be into dry reds, try the Ribera Del Duero Pedrosa Crianza, it’s relatively inexpensive and nearly impossible to find in the US.

        // Located on the island of Kungsholmen, and now with a location in Söder, this successful Scottish brewery has incredible fries and burgers and an intimidating selection of beer. With industrial chic décor and a stylish yet down to earth crowd, it’s the perfect place to grab both a delicious craft beer and high quality pub fare.

        // [ The Flying Elk ]
        // If you’re not up for stepping off the beaten path, this sleek place conveniently located in Gamla Stan offers a good selection of traditional Swedish cuisine. While not the cheapest, it’s a solid choice after a long day of wandering the cobbled streets of Stockholm’s old town.

        // [ The Pelikan ]
        // Located in Södermalm, the bohemian center of Stockholm, this old beer hall offers the chance to try some traditional Swedish fare in pleasant surroundings accentuated by several large and impressive paintings. Split into a trendy bar area – often with only standing room left – and a large hall with individual tables, this restaurant is a good place to check the classic dish of Swedish meatballs off your list. If you’re a lover of swine, try the boiled knuckle of pork – extremely tender and served with 3 different styles of mustard, it does not disappoint.

        // While almost entirely devoid of Mexican cuisine, Stockholm does have one decent option for those who find themselves with a craving. Offering solid tacos in a low-key setting, this Norrmalm hotspot is almost always crowded. Positioned right off the popular walking street of Drottninggatan, you’ll probably find yourself walking by at some point.

        // [ Pizzeria iBolina ]
        // While probably not worth a special trek over to the little island of Lilla Essingen, should you find yourself in the area be sure to stop into iBolina for one of the most inexpensive and delicious meals available in Stockholm. While the thinner crust Swedish style pizza is not everyone’s favorite, it’s the only style you’re likely to find and this place does it the best. For a truly unique and incredibly delicious pizza, try the ‘Alpers Special’ – steak, banana, pineapple and curry with béarnaise sauce on the side.
